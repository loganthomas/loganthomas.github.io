### Introduction to Numerical Computing With NumPy
**Instructor:** Logan Thomas (Enthought, Inc.)

**Overview**: NumPy provides Python with a powerful array processing library and an elegant syntax that is well suited to expressing computational algorithms clearly and efficiently. In this tutorial, I'll introduce basic array syntax and array indexing, review some of the available mathematical functions in NumPy, and discuss how to write your own routines. Along the way, you'll learn just enough about Matplotlib to display results from our examples.

**Tutorial Prerequisites**: The tutorial is intended for people new to the scientific Python ecosystem. Previous experience in Python or another programming language is useful but not required.

**Requirements**: Python 3.6+ with NumPy and Matplotlib are required. Students may follow the installation instructions for Anaconda.

**Notes**: Setup instructions, tutorial materials, and other useful notes can be found on GitHub: [Numpy-Tutorial-SciPyConf-2021](https://github.com/enthought/Numpy-Tutorial-SciPyConf-2021){:target="_blank"}
