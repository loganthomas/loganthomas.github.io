### [PyDev Of The Week: Logan Thomas](https://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/2023/03/13/pydev-of-the-week-logan-thomas/){:target="_blank"}

I had the privilege of being interviewed by [Michael Driscoll](https://www.linkedin.com/in/driscollis/){:target="_blank"}
for his regular PyDev of the Week column on his personal blog, [Mouse vs Python](https://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/){:target="_blank"}.
We discussed my background, why I started using Python, what I'm working on currently, and my favorite Python libraries.
I'm honored to have been selected and enjoyed getting to know Michael.
