### [PyTorch Docathon H2 2024 Wrap-up](https://pytorch.org/blog/pytorch-docathon-h2-2024-wrap-up/){:target="_blank"}

I'm thrilled to share that I've secured second place in the recent PyTorch Docathon.
It's been a pleasure contributing to the documentation alongside so many talented
individuals. Together, we've made significant strides in enhancing PyTorch's
accessibility and usability for developers worldwide.

A big thank you to everyone involved and to Team PyTorch for organizing this
inspiring event.
