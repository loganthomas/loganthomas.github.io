### [Build a scalable feature engineering pipeline with polars | Fullstory](https://www.fullstory.com/blog/feature-engineering-pipeline-with-polars/){:target="_blank"}

Feature engineering is the bridge between raw data and machine learning insights. This post demonstrates how to build production-ready feature engineering pipelines using [Polars](https://pola.rs/){:target="_blank"}, a high-performance `DataFrame` library that balances speed with developer experience.

While Python offers several frameworks for data processing ([pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/){:target="_blank"} for ease of use, [PySpark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/){:target="_blank"} for distributed computing), `Polars` provides an efficient middle ground for building scalable, maintainable pipelines. The article covers practical techniques for parsing `JSON` data with `JSONPath` syntax and transforming event streams into powerful ML-ready features. Learn how to convert every click, scroll, and pause into predictive insights using a modern approach to feature engineering.
