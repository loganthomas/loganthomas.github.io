### [PyTorch Docathon H1 2025 Wrap-up](https://pytorch.org/blog/pytorch-docathon-2025-wrap-up/){:target="_blank"}

Another great PyTorch Docathon has come to an end!

I had an incredible time contributing to an open-source project that’s at the heart of so much cutting-edge research in machine learning, AI, and data science. Being part of the Python community and having opportunities like this to collaborate, learn, and give back is something I truly value.

While it’s another second-place finish for me 🥈 — what matters most is contributing to the greater good. Open-source is about impact, not just placement, and I’m proud to support a project that empowers researchers and developers around the world.

Huge thanks to the PyTorch team and community for making this event happen! Looking forward to the next one 💪 🐍
