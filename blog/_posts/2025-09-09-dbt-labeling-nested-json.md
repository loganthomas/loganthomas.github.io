### [A practical guide to processing Fullstory events with dbt | Fullstory](https://www.fullstory.com/blog/dbt-labeling-nested-json-for-ml/){:target="_blank"}

Behavioral data holds immense potential for machine learning applications, but extracting meaningful insights from raw event streams can be challenging. This post explores how to transform nested `JSON` from Fullstory's behavioral data into structured, labeled datasets using [dbt (data build tool)](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/introduction){:target="_blank"}.

The article demonstrates a modular approach to handling complex user interactions, breaking down the transformation process into discrete, manageable steps. From event unnesting to session labeling, you'll learn how to build robust data pipelines that convert mouse movements, clicks, scrolls, and form completions into ML-ready features.
