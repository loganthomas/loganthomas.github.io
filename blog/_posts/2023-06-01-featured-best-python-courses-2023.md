### [Best 5 Python Courses (2023)](https://www.aitimejournal.com/best-python-courses/44616/){:target="_blank"}

I'm honored that my ["Writing Efficient Python Code"](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/writing-efficient-python-code){:target="_blank"}
course has been mentioned as one of the Best 5 Python Courses of 2023 by the AI Time Journal.
Since developing this course in 2019, it has seen over 95,000 learners and boasts an impressive 4.7+ rating.
Drawing on this experience, I've been fortunate enough to spend the past 2 years developing
more great courses like this for Enthought!

If you're interested in python, data analytics, machine learning, or software development,
check out one of our many courses in the [Enthought Academy](https://www.enthought.com/course-catalog/){:target="_blank"}.
As a co-author for many of these courses, I can attest to the fantastic quality of these offerings.

Thank you to [Adeola Adegunwa](https://www.aitimejournal.com/author/adeola-adegunwa/){:target="_blank"}
