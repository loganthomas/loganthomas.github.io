### [Choosing the Right Number of Clusters - Enthought, Inc.](https://www.enthought.com/blog/number-of-clusters/){:target="_blank"}
When I first started my machine learning journey, [K-means clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering){:target="_blank"} was one of the first algorithms I was introduced to – and it is still one of my favorites to this day. I was amazed at how elegant yet comprehensible the procedure was. There is something oddly satisfying about watching the cluster assignments and centroids being updated with each iteration. While K-means clustering has been tried and true since its inception in the 1950s, there is still one foundational requirement for employing this method: choosing the correct number of clusters – the *K* in K-means. In this month’s newsletter, we’ll explore a technique known as the elbow method to help determine the ideal number of clusters that should be chosen for a given clustering task. To conclude, we will explore another type of clustering algorithm ([Affinity Propagation clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affinity_propagation){:target="_blank"}) that *does not* require a predetermined number of clusters for execution.
