Hi, I'm Logan.

I currently work for [Enthought](https://www.enthought.com/){:target="_blank"} as a Scientific Software Developer and Technical Trainer. Previously, I worked for a protective design firm as a machine learning engineer and I've also been employed as a data scientist in the digital media industry.

I am passionate about software and love sharing my knowledge with others. This is my personal blog where I share helpful information about data science, machine learning, and python.

If you're interested in discussing any of the topics listed on this site, looking for training/mentorship, or just want to catch up over a cup of coffee (in-person or remote), feel free to reach out to me at [logan.thomas005@gmail.com](mailto:logan.thomas005@gmail.com?subject=[Website Contact])
