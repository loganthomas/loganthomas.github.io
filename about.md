<br/>
I currently work for [Fullstory](https://www.fullstory.com/){:target="_blank"}
as a data science software engineer.
Before Fullstory, I was employed by [Pattern Bioscience](https://pattern.bio/){:target="_blank"}
as a member of the software team supporting efforts in pathogen identification (ID) and
antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST).
I've also served as a scientific software developer and Python instructor for
[Enthought](https://www.enthought.com/){:target="_blank"},
worked for a protective design firm ([PEC](https://www.protection-consultants.com/){:target="_blank"})
as a machine learning engineer, and been employed by [Nielsen](https://www.nielsen.com/){:target="_blank"}
as a data scientist in the digital media industry.

I am passionate about software and love sharing my knowledge with others.
This is my personal blog where I share helpful information about data science,
machine learning, and Python.
